Walking Home,"2:19 pm on February 23, 2014",F,F,"
        I saw you... Asian grad-student looking girl trying to walk home, even though you were too drunk to stand. You didn't really look like you wanted to go with the guy who was trying to get you wherever you were going. After the 5th time I saw you fall into the snow trying to cross Kresge, I finally called EMS. Hopefully you're ok...

        I saw you Freshman girl in Leadership Training Institute. You're an inspiration to all the high school students in the program! I wish I had the courage to ask you out...

        I saw you...I miss our deeper conversations and our friendship in general. You were the only one to really notice anything wrong last semester. 
But you don't want to seem to hang with me now, and it sort of feels like last year all over again. I don't want to open up and have one or two deep conversations just to never talk about it again. 
You have friends you like better now, and there's nothing I can do about that. It's partially my fault as well. 
I just really need somebody to talk to.

        I saw you super cute guy - walking past walker in the rain, munching your lunch and wearing old jogging bottoms and a hoodie, hood pulled over your head.
Who ARE you? Do you even go here?

        And, happy melodist, unwearied,
         For ever piping songs for ever new; 
...
         That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
                A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
